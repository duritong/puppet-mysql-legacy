# This logname can be set in /etc/my.cnf
# by setting the variable "err-log"
# in the [safe_mysqld] section as follows:
#
# [safe_mysqld]
# err-log=/var/log/mysqld.log
#
# If the root user has a password you have to create a
# /root/.my.cnf configuration file with the following
# content:
#
# [mysqladmin]
# password = <secret> 
# user= root
#
# where "<secret>" is the password. 
#
# ATTENTION: This /root/.my.cnf should be readable ONLY
# for root !

# Then, un-comment the following lines to enable rotation of mysql's log file:

/var/log/mysqld.log {
        create 640 mysql mysql
        notifempty
        daily
        rotate 3
        missingok
        compress
    postrotate
        # just if mysqld is really running
        if test -x /usr/bin/mysqladmin && \
